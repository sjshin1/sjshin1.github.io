					<p class="work-desc">I interviewed one CS student who is actively looking for a job and two people already working in the industry that I want to be in. As all three interviewees pursue computer science related career, they all similarly expected personal projects/previous works and resume from seeing a website portfolio. They also similarly answered that a website portfolio would be an extension of the typical text resumes which could be used to promote themselves better to the recruiters/employers. Other than to build myself as a better candidate with more projects/works, one thing I learned from the two more professional interviewees was that it is really important to build connections and communications skills with variety of people when working in the real industry.</p>

					<p class="work-desc">For competitor analysis, I analyzed website portfolios of “competitors,” who have similar interests as I do and thus have similar purpose of having their portfolio websites. The three people (Adrian Lange – scientist and developer, Jason Whatson – software developer, and Thomas Edward Knickman – Full Stack Software Engineer) I reviewed were found from Google with a search query “software developer website portfolio,” because software development is the field that I would like to be in. And the reason I reviewed them was because they all had common sections such as ‘resume,’ ‘contact’ and ‘blog,’ but all had different structures and designs to display on their websites. It was very interesting and helpful to see how others would design their website portfolios with similar features. From this task, I realized that it would be great to have technical blog posts as well as to provide a downloadable resume for better contents.</p>

					<p class="work-desc">I picked 6 major features from my midterm-version portfolio and 2 extra features that I would like to include for the future improvement. The whole process of creating feature value matrix was to give each feature a user, business and technical value to measure each feature’s total value, and the features with lower total scores were considered better-valued (higher priority). This was because the lower the user and business value, the higher degree of value they deliver to both the user and business, and the lower the technical value, the less development effort required. The features I analyzed in this matrix were the ones I thought were key to be included in portfolio websites for the purpose of providing easy access to anyone trying to learn more about myself.</p>

					<p class="work-desc">Based on the feature value matrix I created, I was able to prioritize the features and see which features should be built further down the road. When building more complex interfaces in practice, it wouldn’t always be the case that every features could be developed. So both feature value matrix and feature prioritization could be used for important decision making process so that the highest prioritized features could be built first.</p>

					<p class="work-desc">Considering myself as different types of users, I was able to tell what the specific user might want from seeing my portfolio. As many portfolio websites would do, my website portfolio mainly targets hiring managers, so it would be important to provide them easy access to my skills, interests, projects and previous experiences. In the meantime, considering non-career-related users such as family or friends, it would be great to have personal background and image of myself (clickable for larger view). And regardless of the types of users, it would be essential to make my interface responsive to smaller devices, so that anyone can easily access my site with any kind of devices.</p>

					<p class="work-desc">Cognitive walkthrough was to walk through users a series of tasks to determine if they can complete them. It was especially helpful part of the project because I actually was able to observe how users would use/respond to my interface. As intended, all three users liked the simplicity and color schemes of my pages that I would like to continue keeping. But at the same time, I also realized some flaws in the navigation menus on the top right corner on each page and in the alignment of the floral letter on the main page.</p>

					<p class="work-desc">The two tests I conducted were “Send-Email” Click Test and “Navigate-to-Home” Navigation Test. The reason I picked these two tests was because they were two of the higher prioritized features from the feature prioritization. As the title suggests, the first test was to see if users can successfully find an email icon among four different contact icons (Email, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram). Among 11 testers, 9 testers clicked the correct icon while one picked LinkedIn and the other picked Facebook. The second test was to see if users can navigate to other pages using navigation menus instead of back buttons. Among 10 responses, only four users clicked the correct menu while two clicked back buttons, the other two clicked email button, and one clicked Facebook. One challenge I had was that some users didn’t read the test questions correctly and led to very random/unreasonable results.</p>

		<h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
		<section class="main-content final-desc">
			<span>Through user research and user testing, I found out two things that most website portfolios have but I missed: resume and technical blog. All three websites from the competitor analysis had both elements, as well as one interviewee of the user interview explicitly pointed out that he would expect blog posts from seeing a website portfolio. Considering features I have missed for the midterm, I included the extra two features, "Download Resume" and "Detailed Work Page" in the feature value matrix so that I could consider them for the future improvements.</span>
			<p>One irony that I found from feature value matrix was that the most important feature to be included in our midterm project, "Responsive Design," was not actually measured as the highest priority. It was because it required relatively higher technical effort than most of the other features in spite of its importance to users and business. So I realized the importance of features doesn’t guarantee their priority.</p>
			<p>Through user testing, I received some useful and some not as useful feedback from the users. The feedback I received from the cognitive walkthrough was especially helpful, as I was able to observe how users would actually use my interface. From this, I realized that while users all liked the use of colors, one user said she was confused by the meaning of the colors at first. Since coloring is the main design focus of my website, I would keep this in mind when deciding colors.</p>
			<p>As I’ve always heard, the users’ laziness was clearly shown while conducting user testing. While it was very helpful to realize that the navigation menus were too small for some users, some users’ random clicks gave me not as helpful test results.</p>
			<hr>

		<h2>Incorporation of Findings</h2>
		<section class="main-content final-desc">
			<span>As discussed in the summary of findings, the main improvements I would work on would be to add an actual resume file, to provide detailed "Work" page with links to demo the projects I've done, to create technical blog section, and to better design the navigation menus.</span>
			<p>In order to incorporate these changes so that it becomes more likekly "an extension of resume" that I learned from the user interview, I would further develop "Work" page, where I already have a list of past experiences and projects. I would make the titles or images of each item clickable so that it will take the users to the actual project demos. Then, I would add a downloadable resume file to the same page, so that anyone interested in hiring me would be able to download it. Besides "Work" page, I would add a new page called "Blog" to include interesting technical posts. This was an interesting feature that I learned from both user interviews and competitor analysis.</p>
			<p>Finally, as it was shown during user testing, I would have to re-design the navigation menus on each page to be a little bigger and easier to find. As one of the users suggested during cognitive walkthrough, I could possibly place the four buttons in-between the title and the main contents of each page.</p>
